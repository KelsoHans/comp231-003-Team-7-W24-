CAR B&B 

 

A.	Executive Summary 

In this modern world, ease of travel or commuting is one of the most common problems we still encounter. Having transportation to use for daily routines or travels can give us freedom and comfort while on going to places. Although there are tons of car rental companies that cater to people who cannot afford a car, there are still certain issues such as price, store location, etc. that plague them in renting a vehicle.  

On the other hand, many car owners may find that their vehicles remain idle for a sizable portion of the time. Recognizing this untapped resource, car owners are interested in exploring opportunities to make profits with their idle cars by leasing them to others. 

How will this kind of problem be solved? A car sharing platform can serve as an intermediary, connecting car owners with potential renters and facilitating seamless transactions. In this case, it is a win-win situation for both parties: The car owners can have an additional income while the renters can access a wide range of vehicles at lower prices, compared to traditional car rental services.
